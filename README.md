# CS146_MaximumSubarray

This project uses three different algorithms to solve the maximum subarray problem. The first is a Brute Force algorithm that 
uses O(n^2) time and considers all possible arrival and departure times. The second is a divide and conquer algorithm that
takes O(n lg n) time. The third one is Kadane's algorithm that takes O(n) time and is a dynamic programming algorithm.
